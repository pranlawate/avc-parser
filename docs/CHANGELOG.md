## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Smart Path Normalization** (Based on setroubleshoot)
  - `/proc/<pid>` normalization with cross-process access detection (security-aware)
    - Process accessing own /proc: `/proc/1234/fd` → `/proc/<pid>/fd` (normalized)
    - Cross-process access: `/proc/5678/fd` preserved + flagged as potential security issue
    - Prevents hiding security-critical cross-process access patterns
  - Pipe/socket instance stripping: `pipe:[12345]` → `pipe` (uses tclass for accuracy)
  - Abstract socket handling: `\0path` → `@path` (display convention)
  - Comprehensive test suite with 15+ test cases validating all edge cases

- **Enhanced Path Resolution**
  - CWD-based relative path resolution using os.path.join
  - Handles `../` normalization correctly for cleaner absolute paths
  - Only applies to relative paths when CWD is available and absolute

- **Sophisticated PATH Record Matching**
  - Implements setroubleshoot's PATH record selection algorithm
  - Avoids PARENT nametype records when possible
  - Matches PATH records by name field from AVC record for accuracy
  - Collects all PATH records instead of just using last one

- **Source Resolution Priority**
  - Implements setroubleshoot's exe/comm priority: SYSCALL > AVC > scontext.type
  - Maintains transparency with source tracking metadata
  - More accurate process identification

### Fixed
- **Path Resolution Priority Bug**
  - AVC record paths now correctly take priority over PATH record paths
  - Fixed fallback logic that was incorrectly overwriting valid AVC paths with dev:inode identifiers
  - PATH records only used when AVC record has no path field

- **Python 3.9 Compatibility**
  - Fixed import ordering (moved `from __future__ import annotations` to top)
  - Ensures compatibility with Python 3.9 while maintaining 3.10+ syntax

### Changed
- **Path Normalization Benefits**
  - Better deduplication (ephemeral PIDs and inodes normalized)
  - More readable output (abstract sockets, normalized paths)
  - Security-aware (cross-process access flagged, not hidden)
  - System-independent (no filesystem I/O, no external commands)
  - Forensically accurate (shows patterns, not ephemeral instances)

## [1.7.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added
- **Phase 11B: Enhanced Detailed View & Context-Aware Analysis**
  - Per-PID, per-resource breakdown in consolidated groups with timestamps, syscalls, exit codes, success/failure status
  - Context-aware permission descriptions that vary by resource type ("write on dir" vs "write on file")
  - Multiple tclass handling with separate sesearch commands for each class
  - Resource type separation in consolidation signatures (files vs directories)
  - 8 new regression tests for field extraction with quoted/unquoted formats (168 tests total)

- **Phase 11C: Permissive Mode & Report Completeness**
  - Accurate permissive event counting from individual correlations (not group-level)
  - Mixed mode detection showing both enforcing and permissive events
  - Complete target path display in sealert reports (all affected files, not just first)
  - Full raw audit messages with AVC, SYSCALL, and PROCTITLE records
  - 1 new test for mixed permissive mode detection (169 tests total)

- **Phase 11D: Extended Audit Record Support**
  - FANOTIFY support for file access notification denials
  - SELINUX_ERR/USER_SELINUX_ERR support for kernel/userspace SELinux errors
  - MAC_POLICY_LOAD support for policy reload event tracking
  - Specialized display for error types showing invalid context, transition, target class
  - Policy reload events displayed separately from denials
  - Test fixtures for new record types

- **Phase 11E: Code Quality & Development Tooling**
  - Modern project configuration with pyproject.toml (metadata, dependencies, dev tools)
  - Ruff linting and formatting (line-length 100, Python 3.8+ target, auto-fix enabled)
  - Pytest framework with test discovery, markers, and strict configuration
  - Coverage reporting with baseline metrics (19.15% source code coverage established)
