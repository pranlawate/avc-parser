# AVC Parser Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

SELinux AVC denial forensic analysis tool for security analysts, system administrators, and compliance auditors. Focus on post-incident log analysis with intelligent deduplication and clear correlation tracking.

## âœ… **COMPLETED PHASES**

### **Phase 1-4: Foundation (COMPLETED)**
Core parsing, validation, correlation, semantic analysis, and JSON normalization

### **Phase 5: Architecture & Quality Tools (COMPLETED - 2025-09-26)**
- Modularization: 4870-line monolith â†’ 3-module architecture
- Ultra-fast development workflow with ruff migration (197x performance gain)
- Comprehensive testing framework with all tests passing

### **Phase 6: Critical Bug Fixes & UX (COMPLETED - 2025-09-26)**
- BIONIC readability improvements for dark backgrounds
- Enhanced error handling and user guidance
- Performance validation post-modularization

### **Phase 7: Comprehensive Test Coverage (COMPLETED - 2025-09-26)**
- Test suite expansion: 107 â†’ 146 tests (+39 new tests)
- Regression prevention framework with automated validation
- Display layer, malformed log, and integration testing

### **Phase 8: Enhanced User Experience (COMPLETED - 2025-09-28)**
- **Phase 8A**: Interactive pager mode (`--pager` flag) with color preservation (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 8B**: Smart resource display with context-aware formatting (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 8C**: SELinux Policy Investigation Integration with auto-generated `sesearch` commands (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 8D**: Two-tier professional report system (`--report [format]` flag) for different audiences (COMPLETED)
  - **Implementation**: `--report brief` (executive summaries) and `--report sealert` (technical analysis) formats
  - **Features**: Business impact language, comprehensive forensic details, policy investigation commands, terminology consistency
  - **Testing**: 7 comprehensive tests added (149â†’156 total test suite)

## ðŸ”® **NEXT PHASES**

### **ðŸ“‹ PLANNED PHASES**

**Phase 9A: Architectural Refactoring** (ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Steps 1-3 COMPLETED)
- **Objective**: Modularize 5,168-line monolithic parse_avc.py into maintainable architecture
- **Progress**: 616 lines extracted (12% reduction: 5,168â†’4,552 lines) with 100% test coverage maintained
- **Completed**:
  - âœ… Step 1: config/constants.py (configuration extraction)
  - âœ… Step 2: validators/file_validator.py (validation logic extraction)
  - âœ… Step 3: formatters/json_formatter.py (JSON formatting extraction)
- **Benefits Achieved**: Improved modularity, zero regressions, foundation for remaining extractions
- **Safety**: Checkpoint branch created, all 160 tests passing after each extraction

**Phase 9B: Integration & Performance Testing**
- Real-world scenario validation across distributions
- Performance benchmarking and optimization on refactored architecture
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

**Phase 10: Enhanced Documentation** (âœ… Substantially Complete)
- Comprehensive user guides and examples
- Developer documentation and architecture overview
- CLI reference and troubleshooting guides

**Phase 11: Distribution & Packaging**
- **11A**: RPM packaging for Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
- **11B**: PyPI module with modern Python packaging
- **11C**: Additional formats (Debian, AUR, containers)
- **11D**: Release automation and cross-platform testing

## ðŸš« **OUT OF SCOPE**

**Explicitly excluded from project scope:**
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Web interfaces and graphical dashboards
- Policy file analysis and automated recommendations
- Complex event streaming and live correlation
- System behavior analysis beyond audit logs

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**

**Current Status**: Production-ready forensic analysis tool with progressive modularization
- **Architecture**: Clean modular design (6 modules: core + config, validators, formatters, context, utils)
- **Code Organization**: 12% reduction in main file (5,168â†’4,552 lines) with zero regression
- **Testing**: 160 comprehensive tests with regression prevention (100% pass rate maintained)
- **Performance**: Sub-second analysis of large audit logs
- **User Experience**: Professional Rich display with policy investigation workflow

**Distribution Goals**:
- RPM packages in Fedora/EPEL repositories
- PyPI module for cross-platform development
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## ðŸ›  **Development Workflow**

**Quality Assurance**: Ultra-fast ruff-based validation
**Testing**: Automated regression prevention framework
**Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
**Documentation**: User-focused guides with technical implementation details
