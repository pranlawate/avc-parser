# AVC Parser Enhancement Roadmap

Focused implementation plan for enhancing the AVC parser with correlation tracking and professional display capabilities.

## 🎯 Application Scope

**Purpose**: Post-incident SELinux audit log forensic analysis
**Users**: Security analysts, system administrators, compliance auditors
**Function**: Parse, correlate, and present SELinux denial patterns for human analysis

### 🔍 **Scope Boundaries**

**✅ IN SCOPE:**
- Static audit log file analysis | Human-readable semantic analysis
- Correlation tracking for PID-to-resource mapping | Professional terminal & JSON output
- File format auto-detection | Deduplication with intelligent aggregation

**❌ OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Real-time monitoring | Policy file analysis | Web interfaces
- Event streaming | Automated remediation | System behavior tracking

### 🎨 **Design Principles**
1. **Forensic Focus**: Post-incident analysis clarity over real-time features
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Python + Rich only (no policy files)
3. **Correlation Clarity**: Simple mapping solutions over complex architectures
4. **Professional Output**: Terminal-friendly with clean JSON export

## 💡 Core Problems Solved

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Correlation Loss** | PID-to-resource mapping through simple correlation storage |
| **Argument Confusion** | Single `--file` flag with auto-detection |
| **Display Limitations** | Rich-based responsive formatting |
| **User Experience** | Semantic analysis + auto-detection |

## Design Decisions Made

### 1. Rich Rule Header Format (Selected)
**Chosen Format:**
```
─────────── Unique Denial #1 • 2 occurrences • last seen 2 weeks ago ───────────
system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 → unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
Denied read (Read file content), write (Modify file content) on file

Events:
• PID 1234 (httpd) denied 'read' to file /var/www/html/file1.html [Enforcing] ✗ BLOCKED
• PID 5678 (httpd-worker) denied 'write' to file /var/www/html/file2.html [Permissive] ✓ ALLOWED
```

**Why Selected:**
- Superior terminal responsiveness (Rich automatically handles width)
- Professional appearance across all terminal sizes
- Better copy-paste compatibility
- Integrates with existing color theme
- Automatic ASCII fallback built-in

### 2. Correlation Tracking Approach
**Solution:** Store individual event correlations alongside aggregated data
```python
correlations = [
    {"pid": "1234", "comm": "httpd", "path": "/file1", "permission": "read", "permissive": "0"},
    {"pid": "5678", "comm": "httpd-worker", "path": "/file2", "permission": "write", "permissive": "1"}
]
```

**Benefits:**
- Solves PID-to-resource mapping problem
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Enables detailed event breakdown
- Supports ratio analysis (1:9, 2:8, etc.)

### 3. Sorting Strategy
- **Default:** Recent first (by last_seen) - most practical for daily use
- **`--sort count`:** High frequency first - for system administrators
- **`--sort chrono`:** Oldest first - maintains current behavior for audit analysis

### 4. Legacy Compatibility
- **`--legacy-format`** flag preserves current output format
- Existing `print_summary()` function kept intact
- Smooth migration path for existing users/scripts

### 5. Semantic Analysis (Policy-Independent)
- Human-readable permission descriptions using static mappings
- Context intelligence based on object class + permission combinations
- No policy file access required - works with audit logs alone

   - Added validation for directories, binary files, non-existent files
   - Improved error messages for edge cases

2. **Correlation Loss Problem**:
   - Current deduplication loses PID-to-resource mapping
   - Users can't determine which PID accessed which path
   - Ratio confusion (1:9, 2:8, etc.) when multiple processes/paths involved

3. **Display Format Limitations**:
   - Current verbose format doesn't scale across terminal sizes
   - Poor copy-paste compatibility
   - Limited visual hierarchy

### setroubleshoot Analysis Insights
