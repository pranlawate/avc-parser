**Reason**: Provides architectural clarity while maintaining minimal dependencies and scope compliance
**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: PLANNED (Phase 5)

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: JSON Field Normalization for Tool Integration
**Proposal**: Standardize JSON output field formats (paths, ports, contexts) to enable reliable integration with external tools like selinux-ai-tool
**Scope Check**: ‚úÖ Within "Professional terminal & JSON output" and "Human-readable semantic analysis" boundaries
**Complexity Assessment**: ‚úÖ LOW - Enhancement to existing parsing logic

**Status**: PLANNED

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: Smart Event Grouping by Directory Paths
**Proposal**: Intelligent grouping of events by common directory paths to reduce output volume for large audit logs
**Problem**: Real-world audit logs generate hundreds of similar events that overwhelm forensic analysis
**Solution**:
- Group events by common parent directories (e.g., "4 files in /var/www/html/")
- Show hierarchical breakdown for subdirectories
- Maintain individual display for single events and non-file objects
- Add `--expand-groups` flag for full detail when needed
**Benefits**:
- Dramatically reduces output volume for large logs

- Improves pattern recognition for incident analysis
- Preserves existing functionality
**Reason**: Solves real usability problem identified in production usage without scope creep
**Date**: 2025-09-22 (Phase 3B-2)
**Status**: PLANNED

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: Smart Deduplication Logic (SELinux Remediation-Aware Signatures)
**Proposal**: Replace current signature logic with intelligent grouping based on SELinux remediation patterns
**Problem Solved**: Current logic has two critical flaws:
1. Different services (httpd vs nginx) incorrectly grouped when sharing same SELinux contexts
2. Related permissions (read/write/getattr) unnecessarily split when same `semanage` command fixes all
**Solution**:
- Service distinction: Add process categorization to distinguish different services with same contexts
- Permission grouping: Group related permissions that share common remediation strategies
- Path pattern matching: Extract remediation patterns (e.g., `/home/*/` for fcontext rules)
- SELinux domain intelligence: Identify multi-service domains requiring process distinction
**Technical Approach**:
- Filesystem objects: Group by `(source_domain, target_type, filesystem, path_pattern)`
- Network objects: Group by `(source_domain, port, protocol)`
- Process distinction: Use process categorization for `unconfined_t`, `init_t`, etc.
- Permission categories: `file_access` (read/write/getattr), `execute`, `net_bind`, etc.
**Benefits**:
- Optimal `semanage` command correlation - each group solved by single command
- Proper service distinction while maintaining permission efficiency
- Reduced output volume without losing forensic precision
- Matches actual administrator remediation workflow
**Scope Compliance**: ‚úÖ Enhances forensic analysis accuracy without external dependencies
**Implementation Priority**: Phase 3B-2 Priority 1 (foundation for other grouping features)
**Risk Analysis**:
- Edge Cases: Minimal impact - fallback to basic signature when smart logic fails
- Performance: <1% overhead for 79K+ event logs (negligible for forensic use)
- Backward Compatibility: ‚úÖ JSON format unchanged - signature is internal grouping logic
- User Control: `--legacy-signatures` flag for regression testing and edge cases
**Data Sources Analyzed**: testRAW audit logs (79K+ events), selinux-policy access_vectors, setroubleshoot signature logic
**Date**: 2025-09-23 (Phase 3B-2)
**Status**: COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: Smart Event Grouping by Directory Paths
**Proposal**: Intelligent grouping of events by common directory paths to reduce output volume for large audit logs
**Problem**: Real-world audit logs generate hundreds of similar events that overwhelm forensic analysis
**Solution**:
- Group events by common parent directories (e.g., "4 files in /var/www/html/")
- Show hierarchical breakdown for subdirectories
- Maintain individual display for single events and non-file objects
- Add `--expand-groups` flag for full detail when needed
**Benefits**:
- Dramatically reduces output volume for large logs
- Maintains critical forensic information
- Improves pattern recognition for incident analysis
- Preserves existing functionality
**Reason**: Solves real usability problem identified in production usage without scope creep
**Date**: 2025-09-23 (Phase 3B-2)
**Status**: COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: Pipe Compatibility Fix
**Proposal**: Handle broken pipe errors when output is redirected to `head`, `less`, and similar terminal utilities
**Problem**: Rich Console throws BrokenPipeError when output is piped to tools that close early (like `head`)
**Solution**:
- Add signal.SIGPIPE handling to gracefully exit on broken pipes
- Wrap console operations with try/catch for BrokenPipeError
- Ensure clean exit without error traces
**Technical Approach**:
- Signal handler for SIGPIPE (signal 13)
- Exception handling around Rich Console operations
- Graceful degradation when pipe is broken
**Benefits**:
- Fixes critical usability issue affecting daily workflows
- Enables standard Unix pipe patterns: `tool | head`, `tool | less`
- Maintains professional behavior consistent with other CLI tools
**Reason**: Critical usability fix for standard terminal operations
**Date**: 2025-09-24 (Phase 4A)
**Status**: COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: Interactive Pager Mode
**Proposal**: Built-in `less`-like interface with arrow keys, page up/down, and 'q' to quit for large outputs
**Problem**: Large audit log outputs are difficult to navigate in terminal without external paging tools
**Solution**:
- Add `--pager` or `--interactive` command-line flag
- Implement keyboard navigation (arrow keys, page up/down, home/end)
- Add 'q' key to quit, '/' for search functionality
- Display status line with current position and total items
**Technical Approach**:
- Use `termios` for raw terminal input handling
- Buffer output content for pagination
- Implement screen drawing with terminal control sequences
- Handle terminal resize events gracefully
**Benefits**:
- Enhanced user experience for large outputs
- Reduces dependency on external paging tools
- Professional interactive interface for forensic analysis
- Integrates seamlessly with existing output formats
**Reason**: Significantly improves usability for large audit files
**Date**: 2025-09-24 (Phase 4B)
**Status**: PLANNED

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: PID Event Count Display
**Proposal**: Show event frequency per PID in compact view (e.g., `PID 1234 (3x)`) for better correlation understanding
**Problem**: In compact view, deduplication hides how many events each PID generated, making correlation analysis difficult
**Solution**:
- Display event count only when PID has multiple events: `PID 1234 (3x)`
- No count for single events: `PID 5678` (clean display)
- Apply only to compact view where deduplication occurs
- No count in expand-groups view where individual events are already shown
**Benefits**:
- Immediate visibility into event frequency without expanding details
- Clean display that only shows counts when meaningful
- Better correlation analysis in default view
- No clutter in detailed views
**Reason**: High value, minimal complexity, improves core forensic analysis capability
**Date**: 2025-09-24 (Phase 4A)
**Status**: COMPLETED
