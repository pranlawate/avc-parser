**Prerequisites**: Completion of Phase 4C safety infrastructure
**Impact Analysis**:
- New contributors cannot understand codebase structure
- Long-term maintenance becomes exponentially difficult
- Code navigation and debugging severely impaired
- Violates single responsibility principle across entire application

**Proposed Modular Architecture**:
```

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aggregator.py        # Data aggregation (~300 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filters/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time_filter.py       # Time filtering (~200 lines)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context_filter.py    # SELinux context (~150 lines)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ process_filter.py    # Process filtering (~150 lines)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers.py           # Utility functions (~200 lines)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.py         # Constants, mappings (~100 lines)
```

**Implementation Strategy**:

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED: Smart Deduplication Logic (SELinux Remediation-Aware Signatures)
**Proposal**: Replace current signature logic with intelligent grouping based on SELinux remediation patterns
**Problem Solved**: Current logic has two critical flaws:
1. Different services (httpd vs nginx) incorrectly grouped when sharing same SELinux contexts
2. Related permissions (read/write/getattr) unnecessarily split when same `semanage` command fixes all
**Solution**:
- Service distinction: Add process categorization to distinguish different services with same contexts
- Permission grouping: Group related permissions that share common remediation strategies
- Path pattern matching: Extract remediation patterns (e.g., `/home/*/` for fcontext rules)
- SELinux domain intelligence: Identify multi-service domains requiring process distinction
**Technical Approach**:
- Filesystem objects: Group by `(source_domain, target_type, filesystem, path_pattern)`
- Network objects: Group by `(source_domain, port, protocol)`
- Process distinction: Use process categorization for `unconfined_t`, `init_t`, etc.
- Permission categories: `file_access` (read/write/getattr), `execute`, `net_bind`, etc.
**Benefits**:
- Optimal `semanage` command correlation - each group solved by single command
- Proper service distinction while maintaining permission efficiency
- Reduced output volume without losing forensic precision
- Matches actual administrator remediation workflow
**Scope Compliance**: ‚úÖ Enhances forensic analysis accuracy without external dependencies
**Implementation Priority**: Phase 3B-2 Priority 1 (foundation for other grouping features)
**Risk Analysis**:
- Edge Cases: Minimal impact - fallback to basic signature when smart logic fails
- Performance: <1% overhead for 79K+ event logs (negligible for forensic use)
- Backward Compatibility: ‚úÖ JSON format unchanged - signature is internal grouping logic
- User Control: `--legacy-signatures` flag for regression testing and edge cases
**Data Sources Analyzed**: testRAW audit logs (79K+ events), selinux-policy access_vectors, setroubleshoot signature logic
