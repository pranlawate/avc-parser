# OPTIMIZED DEV-SUITE FOR AVC PARSER
# Fast, reliable, long-term development tools with high ROI

# === TIER 1: ESSENTIAL CORE TOOLS ===
black==25.9.0           # Code formatting - fast, reliable
code2flow==2.5.1        # Function visualization - working well
pre-commit              # Automated hooks - essential
vulture==2.14           # Dead code detection - fast, high value
safety==3.6.2           # Security scanning - dependency focus

# === TIER 2: HIGH-VALUE ADDITIONS ===
isort                   # Import organization - CRITICAL for modularization
pyflakes                # Fast syntax checking (replaces flake8)
bandit                  # Security code analysis (complements safety)

# === TIER 3: SPECIFIC USE CASES ===
refurb==2.2.0          # Python modernization - when needed
# mypy - Use manually for type checking (can be slow)

# === PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS ===
# radon - Fix pipe issues before re-enabling
# Skip: pytest (too slow for 4870-line file)
# Skip: flake8 (replaced by pyflakes + bandit)
# Skip: pylint (too slow)
# Skip: ast-grep-py, bowler, libcst (over-engineered for our use case)

# === MODULARIZATION SPECIFIC ===
# Manual approach preferred over automated tools for 4870-line refactoring
# Git branching strategy for safety
# Systematic function extraction with isort for import management
